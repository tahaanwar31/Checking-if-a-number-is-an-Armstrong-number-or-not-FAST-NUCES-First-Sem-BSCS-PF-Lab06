# Checking-if-a-number-is-an-Armstrong-number-or-not-FAST-NUCES-First-Sem-BSCS-PF-Lab06


This question required us to check whether the number entered by the user is an Armstrong number. I used a while loop that runs until the number becomes zero, extracting each digit from the number by taking the modulus with 10, then removing the last digit by dividing the number by 10. The cubes of the digits are added to a sum. After the loop, I checked whether the sum of the cubes of the digits is equal to the original number. If so, I displayed that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it is not.


9. Write a program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not.An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
